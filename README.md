# Journl 🌿

**Journl** is a digital diary and habit tracker designed specifically for ADHD brains, wrapped in a beautiful, leatherbound aesthetic. It focuses on reducing executive function friction through micro-journaling, partial credit tracking, and guilt-free reinforcement.

## ✨ Philosophy

Journl is built on the belief that **consistency isn't perfection — it's showing up**. We've eliminated the "all-or-nothing" guilt typical of most trackers, replacing it with a supportive, low-friction environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Leatherbound Aesthetic**: A cozy, premium design with vintage parchment and midnight library themes.
- **Micro-Journaling Prompts**: randomized prompts to defeat "blank page paralysis."
- **Emoji-Only Entries**: Maintain your streak with just one tap when writing feels like too much.
- **Partial Credit Habits**: Satisfying progress bars and rewards for multi-step habits.
- **Focus Mode**: A simplified dashboard to prevent decision overwhelm.
- **Zero-Guilt System**: Warm greetings, encouraging messages, and dopamine-boosting celebrations.
